Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening patterns.


🎵🤖 Exciting Project Alert: Music Recommendation System with Machine Learning 🤖🎵

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on—a Music Recommendation System using Machine Learning! 🎶

Music holds a special place in our lives, and this project is all about making your music experience even better. Here's what I've done:

🔍 *Data Collection and Exploration*: I gathered data on songs, user interactions, and user profiles to create a comprehensive dataset.

🔮 *Data Preprocessing*: After a deep dive into the data, I dealt with missing values, transformed categorical variables, and even removed outliers to ensure the data is in top shape.

🎯 *Model Selection*: I experimented with different machine learning models, including LightGBM, RandomForest, and XGBoost, to find the best one for the job.

🎨 *Feature Engineering*: I engineered features, applied Target Encoding to categorical variables, and normalized numeric features to improve model performance.

📊 *Correlation Analysis*: A heatmap helped me visualize feature correlations and make informed decisions about model features.

🧪 *Hyperparameter Tuning*: I used Optuna to optimize hyperparameters for each model, fine-tuning them for the best performance.

🚀 *Results*: The final model achieved an impressive AUC score, showcasing its effectiveness in recommending music tailored to individual tastes.
